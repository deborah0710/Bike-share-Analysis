### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an bike shares company over the last  two years. By gaining a deeper understanding of the company's performance, we are able to recommend if increasing prices the next year is possible. 

### Data Sources
An SQL database was created for this analysis using csv files, containing detailed information about sales made by the company each year and the average cost of products.
